    "The `collatz(number)` function defined above takes an integer as an argument. It calculates the Collatz sequence for that value and tests if that sequence ends in a 4, 2, 1,  loop. If the sequence ends in the 4, 2, 1 loop, the function returns a list that contains the Collatz sequence for that number.  If the sequence for the number does not end in a 4, 2, 1 loop, the function returns the value in a list. Because of the conditions implemented in the function an allowance has to be made for the numbers 1 and 2. To test them against the 4, 2, 1 loop the assumption that all Collatz sequence numbers end in a 4, 2, 1 loop is made by testing them against a list that ends in 4, 2, 1. In this functioon extensive use is made of 'if' and 'else' statements. For any number other than 1 or 2 a 'while' loop is used to generate a list containing the Collatz sequence for that number. "
