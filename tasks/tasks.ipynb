    "\n",
    "The purpose of the *collatz(number)* function is to return the Collatz sequence, in a list, for a given positive integer. If the Collatz Conjecture does not hold true for that number a list containing the given number is returned. To achieve this the Collatz sequence for the given number is tested against a list that contains the numbers 4, 2, 1 - as per the assumption that every Collatz sequence must end in a 4, 2, 1 loop.\n",

    "The code snippet upon which the function is based calculates the the Collatz sequence for the number 1 as [1] and number 2 as [2, 1]. This creates an issue in so far as the sequence for the numbers 1 and 2 cannot be tested against the [4, 2, 1] loop. To allow for this, an *if* and *elif* statement are used to return the Collatz sequence for the numbers 1 and 2 that include the 4, 2, 1 loop. All other values passed as an argument to the function are divided by 2 if even or if odd they multiplied by 3 and 1 is added to this number. The returned value is appended to a list. A *while* loop is employed to continue this until the output of these mathematical operations reaches 1.\n",
