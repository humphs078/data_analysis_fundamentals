    "Of note, there is an issue caused by limitations in the way in which Python performs floating point arithmetic (docs.python.org, n.d.). Floating point numbers are stored in memory as base 2 binary fractions. Most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions. Thus decimal floating-point numbers are only approximated by the binary floating-point numbers actually stored in the machine. This has the potential to cause inaccuracies when arithmetic is performed on floating point numbers in Python. In the Iris dataset *sepal length*, *sepal width*, *petal length* and *petal width* are stored in the Pandas DataFrame as 64bit floating point numbers. This allows for a high degree of precision and will somewhat mitigate the issue outlined above, albeit at the cost of a computational overhead due to the larger size of this datatype.\n",

However, it appears that the last number is being rounded up to 7 when compared to the table above. Therefore, 1.198667 is an approximation of the mean petal width. Performing the same arithmetic on both numbers will give different results as they are different numbers. This may seem insignificant, however, could lead to inaccurate model development."
