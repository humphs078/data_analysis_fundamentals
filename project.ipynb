    "- create a notebook investigating the variables and data points within the well-known iris flower data set associated with Ronald A Fisher.\n",

    "- Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate summary statistics to describe each variable.\n",

    "in Canada. Two of the three species were collected from the same meadow, by the same person, using standard equipment \n",
    "in order to minimise the risk of variation in the data samples arising from the way in which it was collected and \n",
    "measured. Dr. Anderson is recognised as a significant contributor in the field of botanical genetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen from the picture below the appearance of each species is similar. Sir Fisher's Analysis of the data set\n",
    "enabled accurate classification of the species from petal and sepal measurement and as a result the data set is \n",
    "routinely used as a beginners dataset for machine learning purposes.\n",
