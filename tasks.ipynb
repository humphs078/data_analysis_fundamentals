    "\n",
    "The purpose of the *collatz(number)* function is to return the Collatz sequence, in a list, for a given positive integer. If the Collatz Conjecture does not hold true for that number a list containing the given number is returned. To achieve this the Collatz sequence for the given number is tested against a list that contains the numbers 4, 2, 1 - as per the assumption that every Collatz sequence must end in a 4, 2, 1 loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code snippet upon which the function is based calculates the the Collatz sequence for the number 1 as [1] and number 2 as [2, 1]. This creates an issue in so far as the sequence for the numbers 1 and 2 cannot be tested against the [4, 2, 1] loop. To allow for this, an *if* and *elif* statement are used to return the Collatz sequence for the numbers 1 and 2 that include the 4, 2, 1 loop. All other values passed as an argument to the function are divided by 2 if even or if odd they multiplied by 3 and 1 is added to this number. The returned value is appended to a list. A *while* loop is employed to continue this until the output of these mathematical operations reaches 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *collatz_sequence_list* generated by the while loop is tested for Collatz compliance by comparing the last three numbers in this list against the *loop_list*. If false an *if* statement returns the *wrong_list*. If true, the function returns the *collatz_sequence_list*."

    "The *species*, *island* and *sex* variables are categorical variable types that are nominal. The mathematical operations that can be performed on these variables for analysis are limited to counts of objects. Therefore these variables are not suitable to use as variables for modelling in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Bill length*, *bill depth*, *flipper length* and *body mass* are all numerical variables that are continuous. The level of measure is ratio as the units of each of these variables have an absolute zero e.g. mass or length cannot have a negative value. These variables are classed as continuous as there is an infinite number of values between each number on their scale e.g. there are an infinite number of values between $1$mm and $2$mm and there are an infinite number of values between $1$g and $2$g. As per Sharma (2020), continuous data mathematical operations can include fractions and decimals. All of the numerical data in the Penguins dataset are $64$-bit floating point numbers. This is an issue due to the limitations in the way in which Python performs floating point arithmetic (docs.python.org, n.d.). Floating point numbers are stored in memory as base $2$ binary fractions. Most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions. Thus decimal floating-point numbers are only approximated by the binary floating-point numbers actually stored in the machine. This has the potential to cause inaccuracies when arithmetic is performed on floating point numbers in Python. In the *Penguins* dataset *Bill length*, *bill depth*, *flipper length* and *body mass* stored in Python as $64$bit floating point numbers. This allows for a high degree of precision and will somewhat mitigate the issue outlined above, albeit at the cost of a computational overhead due to the larger size of this datatype.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the *Penguins* dataset *Bill length*, *bill depth*, *flipper length* and *body mass* should be used to model the dataset because:\n",
    "1. These variables are classified as continuous variables.\n",
    "2. The level of measure for these variables is ratio.\n",
    "3. Complex mathematical arithmetic can be performed on these variable types (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).\n",
    "4. Mode, median, arithmetic mean and geometric mean can be calculated on these data types.\n",
    "5. Range, interquartile range, standard deviation, variance & relative standard deviation can be calculated on these variables.\n",
    "6. Measures of correlation between these variables can be quantified.\n",
    "7. These variables are stored as $64$-bit floating point numbers which allows for a high degree of precision which allows for more accurate models.\n",
    "8. Strategies can be adopted to manage the impact of missing values in the dataset when performing models so that the risk of incorrect results, when modelling, is minimised."
